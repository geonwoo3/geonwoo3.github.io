<h3>International attention is urgently needed due to the growing threat of global warming. Increased temperatures, severe weather, and environmental disruptions highlight the urgent need for group action. Without immediate action, the consequences will have an impact on ecosystems, economies, and human well-being, pressing us to protect the future of our world.
